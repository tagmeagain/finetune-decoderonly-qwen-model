,"What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns."
,"How does a neural network work?","A neural network is a computational model inspired by biological neural networks. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Information flows through the network, with each connection having a weight that gets adjusted during training to minimize prediction errors."
,"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?","Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without predefined labels. Supervised learning is used for classification and regression tasks, while unsupervised learning is used for clustering and dimensionality reduction."
,"How do you handle missing data in machine learning?","Missing data can be handled through several methods: 1) Deletion (removing rows or columns with missing values), 2) Imputation (filling missing values with mean, median, mode, or predicted values), 3) Using algorithms that handle missing data natively, or 4) Creating a separate category for missing values."
,"What is overfitting and how do you prevent it?","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, leading to poor generalization on new data. Prevention methods include: 1) Using more training data, 2) Regularization techniques (L1/L2), 3) Cross-validation, 4) Early stopping, 5) Feature selection, and 6) Using simpler models."
,"Explain the concept of cross-validation.","Cross-validation is a technique to assess how well a model will generalize to new data. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on all but one fold, and testing on the held-out fold. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged to get a more reliable performance estimate."
,"What is the bias-variance tradeoff?","The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning. Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm, while variance refers to the error due to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. A good model balances both to minimize total error."
,"How does gradient descent work?","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent. In machine learning, it's used to find the optimal parameters by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters and updating them in the opposite direction of the gradient."
,"What is the difference between precision and recall?","Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions (true positives / (true positives + false positives)), while recall measures the ability to find all positive instances (true positives / (true positives + false negatives)). Precision focuses on quality of predictions, while recall focuses on completeness."
,"Explain the concept of ensemble methods.","Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Common techniques include: 1) Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) - trains multiple models on different subsets of data, 2) Boosting - trains models sequentially, each focusing on errors of previous models, and 3) Stacking - combines predictions from multiple models using a meta-model."
