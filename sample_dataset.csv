,"What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns."
,"How does a neural network work?","A neural network is a computational model inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Data flows through the network, with each neuron processing inputs and passing results to the next layer. The network learns by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons based on training data."
,"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?","Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs, allowing the model to make predictions on new data. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data without predefined outputs."
,"Explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning.","Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, which leads to poor performance on new, unseen data. This happens when the model becomes too complex relative to the amount of training data available."
,"What are the main types of machine learning algorithms?","The main types of machine learning algorithms are: 1) Supervised Learning (classification, regression), 2) Unsupervised Learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction), 3) Semi-supervised Learning (combines labeled and unlabeled data), and 4) Reinforcement Learning (learning through interaction with an environment)."
,"How do you evaluate a machine learning model?","Machine learning models are evaluated using various metrics depending on the task. For classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. For regression: mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. Cross-validation and train/test splits help ensure reliable evaluation."
,"What is deep learning?","Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep') to model and understand complex patterns in data. It's particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition."
,"Explain the concept of gradient descent.","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function of a machine learning model. It works by iteratively adjusting the model's parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function, gradually moving toward the minimum point."
,"What is the difference between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent?","Batch gradient descent computes the gradient using the entire training dataset, providing stable but potentially slow convergence. Stochastic gradient descent uses a single training example at a time, offering faster updates but more noisy gradients. Mini-batch gradient descent strikes a balance by using small batches of data."
,"How do you handle missing data in a dataset?","Missing data can be handled through several methods: 1) Deletion (removing rows or columns with missing values), 2) Imputation (filling missing values with mean, median, mode, or predicted values), 3) Using algorithms that handle missing data natively, or 4) Creating a separate category for missing values."
